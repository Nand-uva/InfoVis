    "For more than a decade, the refugee crisis has been a significant issue within Europe, especially the European Union. Human rights organizations argue that the EU has a moral obligation to assist individuals escaping war and poverty, emphasizing the need to protect these people. These groups highlight that many refugees are fleeing life-threatening situations and require immediate support and a safe place to live.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, some European governments and citizens express concerns about the potential negative impacts of accepting  a large number of refugees. These concerns include the general strain on the country’s welfare, and perhaps challenges with cultural integration. The refugee crisis has sparked intense debates, with different perspectives often clashing over how best to address the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data story will explore the refugee crisis in Europe by analyzing various datasets on migration and more specifically refugees to better understand the realities of the situation. We will examine the actual number of refugees entering European countries, compare this with historical data, and analyze the socioeconomic impacts on host countries. Additionally, we will delve into the narratives surrounding the crisis, assessing whether the situation is as dire as some media and politicians suggest or if the influx of refugees is consistent with past trends."

    "\n",
    "1. **Filtering for European Countries:**\n",
    "   - The analysis focused solely on European countries. Therefore, non-European countries were excluded from the datasets (Turkey is the only country partly in Europe that is included, since it is an interesting and insightful case)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selecting Relevant Columns:**\n",
    "   - Not all columns in each dataset were necessary for the analysis. The specific columns selected for each dataset are as follows:\n",
    "     - **Refugee Interview Dataset:**\n",
    "       - Country of residence during the interview (VAR01)\n",
    "       - Rejection, first instance (VAR27)\n",
    "     - **UN World Refugee Data:**\n",
    "       - Year\n",
    "       - Country of origin\n",
    "       - Country of asylum\n",
    "       - Refugees under UNCHR's mandate\n",
    "     - **World Population Data:**\n",
    "       - Country\n",
    "       - Population over the years\n",
    "     - **World GDP:**\n",
    "       - Country\n",
    "       - GDP Per Capita (Economic output of a country per inhabitant)\n",
    "       - GDP PPP Per Capita (Economic output of a country per inhabitant adjusted for purchasing power)\n",
    "     - **Public Acceptance of Refugees:**\n",
    "       - Reasoning for moving countries (vig_reason)\n",
    "     - **Pending Status Refugees:**\n",
    "       - Year\n",
    "       - Total pending applications start of the year\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Cleaning:**\n",
    "   - Missing values and inconsistencies in the data were addressed. This involved handling null values, correcting data entry errors, and ensuring uniformity in data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Integration:**\n",
    "   - The datasets World Population Data, World GDP & UN World Refugee Data were merged based on country ID and the last overlapping year (2020) for the bubble chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these preprocessing steps, we ensured that the datasets were clean, consistent, and ready for subsequent analysis."

    "The data reveals a consistent rise in the number of refugees per 1000 inhabitants across most European countries, highlighting the growing burden on these nations. The visualizations show that in 9 out of the top 10 countries, refugee numbers rose significantly, indicating substantial pressure on public services and infrastructure. To provide a clearer analysis, we removed the first few years of independence for the Yugoslav countries, as these years had abnormally high peaks due to an abnormal situation. The average line across all countries illustrates a steady increase in refugee numbers, reinforcing the overall trend of rising pressure. Notably, Montenegro stands out as the country with the highest refugee intake per 1000 inhabitants in Europe, primarily due to its ties with Ukraine, leading to a considerable influx of refugees. These trends underscore the urgency of addressing the refugee crisis comprehensively, balancing humanitarian responsibilities with practical concerns about resource allocation and integration challenges. The visualizations clearly indicate that the pressure on public services and infrastructure is escalating, necessitating a coordinated and sustainable response from European nations."

    "As can be seen in both graphs, in recent years, there is a noticeable increase in the number of refugees, especially in the larger countries. Germany and Turkey specifically seems to have a substantial increase in refugees in recent years. Germany seems to have had a substantially larger number of refugees since 1985, likely because it's a large, rich country. From 2012, there is a substantial increase of refugees in Turkey. This is because Turkey provided unlimited duration of stay to Syrians, since a Syrian civil war started in 2011. Turkey is also a transit between Asia and Europe, preventing irregular migration, which results in lots of refugees staying in Turkey. These two counties indicate a poor spread of refugees. \n",

    "It should also be noted that Serbia and Kosovo had a notable amount of refugees between 1992 and 2005 because of the breakup of Yugoslavia combined with the Kosova war and its after effects.

    "While before 2013, the number of applications was relatively stable. This indicates that the recent surge is due to new factors, likely related to Europe’s economic appeal and more generous asylum policies.\n",
